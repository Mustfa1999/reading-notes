# The Growth Mindset

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

> [Back to the main](./README.md)

In programming, regular coding and sticking with what we already know is the major problem that prevents us from improving our skills. We need to do intentional practicing to enhance our programming skills.

That means we need some high-level activities or projects to work on them so they get us out of our comfort zone. These activities should be designed by a teacher that knows what exactly should we learn and when should we learn it. And since you're a self-learner, this teacher will be you!

You need to select a set of challenges that are just above your level. They have to be hard for you so you can gain new knowledge and applied experience by searching for the solution and solving them. But not so hard on your level so you will stuck on them and get depressed. In my opinion, I tried a website calledÂ **Codewars**, it has a massive collection of various levels of challenges. There are a lot more of those websites on the following links:

You also have to keep repeating this technique so it sharpens your skills day after day. And even if you are stuck on a problem, there is a lot of websites made for you to post your question and wait till someone answers it, like Stackoverflow.

## My understanding of Carol Dweck's concept of Growth Mindset

- Positive encouraging phrases must be said to anyone who failed in something instead of the word "Failed" because it keeps them aware that they're not finished yet but still in the race.

- We need to start awarding students and employees for their efforts and progress, not on the final success and finishing the task.

- Giving the minority people their right to education will return a lot of creative people.

## The power of passion and perseverance by Angela Lee Duckworth

- One of the most effective characteristics you need to succeed is grit. Which means the passion of moving forward.

- You have to be gritty about making yourself and whoever is under your responsibilities grittier so we all evolve.

## Alain de Botton, the philosophy of success

- You need to stay away from snob and envy people. The more you're close to them, the more they will become envier and affect your life badly.  

- You shouldn't judge people by any standard before you actually know them.

- You can't be successful in everything. You need to be the author of your idea and make sure that you're not just controlled by others' ideas.

## My Emotional Intelligence and Biases

- I have excellent self-awareness and self-management due to the long time that I spend living alone back in college. Also, I have good relationship management abled me to interact and influence others effectively. On the other hand, my social awareness is on average, so it might need to be enhanced.

- For my biases, I have high self-awareness, curiosity, and courage. But still, I shall continue examining where I still have room for improvement.
