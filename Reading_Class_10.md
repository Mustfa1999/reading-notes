## Stack

Stack: it is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### Stacks follow these concepts:

- FILO (First In Last Out) : This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

- LIFO (Last In First Out) : This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Push 

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

When adding a Node, you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top.


### Pop O(1)

Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a pop. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

## Queue

### Queues follow these concepts:

- FIFO (First In First Out) : This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

- LILO (Last In Last Out) : This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

### Enqueue O(1)

When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

### Dequeue O(1)

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a dequeue. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.
