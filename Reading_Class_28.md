## Django form handling process

Django's form handling uses all of the same techniques that we learned about in previous tutorials (for displaying information about our models): the view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page (from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed). What makes things more complicated is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.

## Django's form handling 

- Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.
The form may contain blank fields if you're creating a new record, or it may be pre-populated with initial values (for example, if you are changing a record, or have useful default initial values).
The form is referred to as unbound at this point, because it isn't associated with any user-entered data (though it may have initial values).

- Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
Binding data to the form means that the user-entered data and any errors are available when we need to redisplay the form.

- Clean and validate the data.

- Cleaning the data performs sanitization of the input fields, such as removing invalid characters that might be used to send malicious content to the server, and converts them into consistent Python types.
Validation checks that the values are appropriate for the field (for example, that they are in the right date range, aren't too short or too long, etc.)
If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.

- If all data is valid, perform required actions (such as save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, and so on).

- Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

Django provides a number of tools and approaches to help you with the tasks detailed above. The most fundamental is the Form class, which simplifies both generation of form HTML and data cleaning/validation. In the next section, we describe how forms work using the practical example of a page to allow librarians to renew books.

## Form fields

In this case, we have a single DateField for entering the renewal date that will render in HTML with a blank value, the default label "Renewal date:", and some helpful usage text: "Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3 weeks)." As none of the other optional arguments are specified the field will accept dates using the input_formats: YYYY-MM-DD (2016-11-06), MM/DD/YYYY (02/26/2016), MM/DD/YY (10/25/16), and will be rendered using the default widget: DateInput.

There are many other types of form fields, which you will largely recognize from their similarity to the equivalent model field classes: BooleanField, CharField, ChoiceField, TypedChoiceField, DateField, DateTimeField, DecimalField, DurationField, EmailField, FileField, FilePathField, FloatField, ImageField, IntegerField, GenericIPAddressField, MultipleChoiceField, TypedMultipleChoiceField, NullBooleanField, RegexField, SlugField, TimeField, URLField, UUIDField, ComboField, MultiValueField, SplitDateTimeField, ModelMultipleChoiceField, ModelChoiceField.

The arguments that are common to most fields are listed below (these have sensible default values):

required: If True, the field may not be left blank or given a None value. Fields are required by default, so you would set required=False to allow blank values in the form.
label: The label to use when rendering the field in HTML. If a label is not specified, Django will create one from the field name by capitalizing the first letter and replacing underscores with spaces (e.g. Renewal date).
label_suffix: By default, a colon is displayed after the label (e.g. Renewal dateâ€‹:). This argument allows you to specify a different suffix containing other character(s).
initial: The initial value for the field when the form is displayed.
widget: The display widget to use.
help_text (as seen in the example above): Additional text that can be displayed in forms to explain how to use the field.
error_messages: A list of error messages for the field. You can override these with your own messages if needed.
validators: A list of functions that will be called on the field when it is validated.
localize: Enables the localization of form data input (see link for more information).
disabled: The field is displayed but its value cannot be edited if this is True. The default is False.

## Validation

Django provides numerous places where you can validate your data. The easiest way to validate a single field is to override the method clean_<fieldname>() for the field you want to check. So for example, we can validate that entered renewal_date values are between now and 4 weeks by implementing clean_renewal_date() as shown below.

    import datetime

    from django import forms

    from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

    class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
        renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")

        def clean_renewal_date(self):
            data = self.cleaned_data['renewal_date']

            # Check if a date is not in the past.
            if data < datetime.date.today():
                raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal in past'))

            # Check if a date is in the allowed range (+4 weeks from today).
            if data > datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=4):
                raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal more than 4 weeks ahead'))

            # Remember to always return the cleaned data.
            return data
